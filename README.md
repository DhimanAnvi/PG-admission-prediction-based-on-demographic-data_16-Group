This project is a machine learning-powered web application designed to predict the likelihood of a student securing admission. The prediction is made based on several input factors including academic scores, entrance exam performance, and the demographic location of the student. The goal is to assist students and academic counselors in understanding how regional and academic variables influence educational and employment outcomes.

The frontend of this application is developed using React and styled with Tailwind CSS to ensure a responsive and intuitive user interface. The backend is powered by Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, which handles incoming requests and communicates with a trained machine learning model stored in a serialized .joblib file. This model is trained using a mix of real and synthetic data based on AICTE reports, NIRF rankings, and other publicly available educational and employment datasets.

The application provides a simple input form where users can enter details such as GPA, entrance exam scores (like JEE, CAT, or GPAT), stream (Engineering, Management, or Pharmacy), state, caste category, and other demographic factors. After submitting this information, the system processes the data through the backend and returns predicted outcomes related to admission chances and job placement likelihood.

The project is organized into two main parts: the frontend directory, which contains the React source code, and the backend directory, which includes the Flask server, machine learning model, and required dependencies. To run the project locally, users should first install the necessary Python packages for the backend using a requirements.txt file, then start the Flask server. Similarly, the frontend can be launched by installing dependencies via npm and starting the React development server.

The machine learning model used in this project is either a Random Forest Classifier or an XGBoost model, offering high accuracy (around 85â€“90%) on the validation dataset. Features considered by the model include entrance exam performance, GPA, state of residence, and chosen stream. This combination allows the model to simulate how different factors might influence institutional admission and job trends across different regions in India.
